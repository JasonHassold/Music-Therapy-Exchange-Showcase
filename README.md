# Music Therapy Exchange Showcase
A showcase of the website Music Therapy Exchange that I built. This website allows music therapists to share and search for interventions (basically treatment plans) as well as commenting on them to discuss the ideas further. The tags which can be seen below in the "Show an Intervention" image are an important part of the search capabilities to find interventions relevant to the patient. 

This project was built using a NodeJS and MongoDB backend, and a Materialize CSS and JQuery frontend.
