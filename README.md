# Music Therapy Exchange Showcase
A showcase of the website Music Therapy Exchange that I built. This website allows music therapists to share and search for interventions (basically treatment plans) as well as commenting on them to discuss the ideas further. The tags, some of which can be seen below in the "Show an Intervention" image, are an important part of the search capabilities to find interventions relevant to the patient. The tags field on the search page auto-populates with all matching tags as you type, and you can sort the search results by both date and number of favorites. 

This project was built using a NodeJS and MongoDB backend, and a Materialize CSS and JQuery frontend.
